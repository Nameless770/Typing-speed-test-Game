An interactive Typing Speed Test Game built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The game challenges players to type randomly generated words within a limited time based on the selected difficulty level.

This project focuses on improving typing speed while practicing JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, timers, game logic, and dynamic content updates.

🎮 How It Works

The player clicks Start Playing.

A random word appears on the screen.

The player must type the word correctly before the timer runs out.

Each correct word increases the score.

The game continues until all words are completed or time runs out.

A final result message is displayed at the end.
